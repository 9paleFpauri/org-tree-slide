## Gameplay
 
Assassins Creed Unity Gold Edition V150 MAXAGENT 29 follows the same gameplay as the original game, with some minor differences. The game is divided into sequences and memories, which are the main story missions. The player controls Arno Dorian, a young Assassin who seeks to uncover the truth behind the French Revolution and his adoptive father's murder. Arno can explore a large open world map of Paris, which is divided into districts with different levels of difficulty and activities. Arno can also travel to other locations such as Versailles and Saint-Denis through fast travel points.
 
The game features a new parkour system that allows Arno to climb up and down buildings and structures with more fluidity and realism. Arno can also use stealth to avoid or eliminate enemies, using various tools and weapons such as hidden blades, swords, pistols, smoke bombs, and phantom blades. The game also introduces a new combat system that is more challenging and realistic than previous games. Arno can engage in melee or ranged combat with enemies, using different types of attacks, parries, dodges, and counters. Arno can also perform assassinations from various angles and positions, such as air, ledge, cover, or double assassinations.
 
The game also features a new customization system that allows the player to change Arno's appearance and equipment. The player can choose from different outfits, hoods, belts, colors, weapons, and gear that have different stats and effects on Arno's skills and abilities. The player can also upgrade Arno's skills through a skill tree that is divided into four categories: melee, ranged, stealth, and health. The player can also collect various collectibles and items throughout the game world, such as chests, cockades, artifacts, letters, and Nostradamus enigmas.
 
The game also features a new co-operative multiplayer mode that allows up to four players to join forces and complete specific missions together. The co-op missions are separate from the main story missions, and have different objectives and challenges. The co-op missions can be accessed through the game map or through a dedicated menu. The co-op mode also has its own customization system that allows the player to change their character's appearance and equipment. The co-op mode also has its own progression system that rewards the player with experience points, money, items, and skills.
